# WAVES_mock_catalogue_generator
This is the official code base to construct WAVES mock catalogues from SHARK/StingRay runs. SHARK and StingRay produce the physcical data and stores these in hdf5 formats on Setonix. This code then scrapes those hdf5 files and produces a usable data product (mock catalogue) for the WAVES colloboration. 

Currenlty this code is in active development in preparation for WAVES and is not yet in its matured form.

To run the code simply install the repo on setonix and run the make_galaxy catlog.py script.
